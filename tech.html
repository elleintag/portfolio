                        Working closely with the project’s web designer, we discussed with the client to develop a solution that fully accommodated their vision, along with their budget, limitations, and needs. With this information, I proceeded to develop the website’s framework based off of the web designer’s product using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to provide the client with a sense of how the website would fully function online. Through several client and team meetings, different copies were developed, tested, and debugged in order to adjust animations, breakpoints, and other technical issues that may have been brought up.

                        Developed within the span of months, Mootate was the result of one of several different ideas and various testing stages. As a group project with strict deadlines, this project amplified the importance of discussing with team members, setting timelines as a group, and working together to debug and solve issues. Within Mootate, I focused on developing the UI, design, and sprite movement and functions using Figma, Unity, and C#. Throughout the course of the project, my team and I performed several different rounds of play-testing, and continuously used our given feedback in development stages for further improvement. Mootate was then presented by our team at the Queen’s Creative Computing Showcase for an official demo at the end of its development.

                        Initially, I constructed an entity-relationship diagram to fully understand the scope of the database. This ensured that every relationship was accounted for, including how a customer would pay for their orders, or how employees were contracted and for how long. From this diagram, I developed a SQL database to store incoming data from customers, and tested the effectiveness of the database using various input queries. The web application was developed using HTML and CSS to present the data to users in a straightforward and simple way.

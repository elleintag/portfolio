                    <p>As the newly appointed Marketing Director for the Queen’s Chapter, I made it a goal to establish a new brand for the club that would fully encompass the work and students, women and girls in STEM, that we wanted to reach. Researching into popular brands and other clubs among female university students such as Glossier, Queen’s Women in Computing, and more, I developed a vision of how WiSE should be displayed based on their marketing campaigns and various designs.  With this, I brought a well-defined and fully functional brand kit that included new logos, colours, and typography to our club. This brand kit was fully implemented within months of its development through extensive team training, and with a consistent reminder to maintain a professional appearance for the club. While the main assets were designed on Figma, the team shifted into Canva to ensure simple, and long-lasting use of the kit for future teams. </p>

                    <p>The P&CC Paper Trail was created with the vision to be printed and stored as a memory for the final year of the Printing & Copy Centre (P&CC) at Queen’s University. Designed entirely on Figma, each monthly edition is produced with extensive design research. The first edition took inspiration from zines, and early 2000’s magazines, while the second edition took design inspiration from the makeup brand, Tower28. As these newsletters are meant to be a fun and creative way to involve and appreciate the staff of the service, I made sure to include components dedicated to the P&CC such as, drawings of the specific printers in store, playlists created by managers, and more. The newsletter is then formatted on Adobe InDesign and printed out for staff to enjoy every month.
